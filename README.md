# 🛡️ Ashar Asad — Cybersecurity Portfolio

## 👋 Introduction
I am a driven cybersecurity professional with a background in computer programming and analysis, combining technical depth with analytical precision.  
Having completed the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and advanced **TryHackMe** paths, I bring hands-on experience in **security monitoring**, **threat analysis**, and **automation** within simulated enterprise environments.  
My mission is to defend digital infrastructures through continuous learning, collaboration, and proactive threat hunting.
